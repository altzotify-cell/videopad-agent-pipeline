.SYNOPSIS
    Runs one pipeline step in a child PowerShell and prints a single JSON verdict.

.DESCRIPTION
    Every tool in tools/ reports success the same way PowerShell always has: it
    emits an object, or it throws. That is fine for a human at a prompt and
    awkward for an agent, which has to decide whether to continue and cannot tell
    a warning from a failure by reading prose on stdout. This wrapper turns any
    step into one machine-readable result:

        { "ok": true, "step": "gate", "exitCode": 0, "timedOut": false,
          "seconds": 2.1, "command": "...", "stdout": "...", "stderr": "" }

    The child runs with -NoProfile -NonInteractive, so a profile cannot change
    behaviour between machines, and with -EncodedCommand, so quoting and
    PowerShell's own parsing cannot mangle the command string. stdout and stderr
    are captured separately and returned verbatim - the wrapper never judges
    their contents, so `ok` means exactly "the step exited 0".

    Why a child process instead of dot-sourcing
    -------------------------------------------
    Several steps poke at global desktop state (synthetic input, window handles,
    the single VideoPad instance). A child gives each step a clean runspace and
    guarantees the exit code survives, which a dot-sourced script does not.

.PARAMETER Command
    The step to run, as a PowerShell command line. It is executed from -WorkDir.

.PARAMETER Step
    Label recorded in the verdict, so a caller can log which step a result
    belongs to ("build", "gate", "export", ...).

.PARAMETER WorkDir
    Directory the command runs in. Defaults to the repo root.

.PARAMETER TimeoutSeconds
    Wall-clock budget. On expiry the child is killed and timedOut is true.
    Default 3600, which covers a long export; pass something small (60) for the
    app-free steps so a hang is caught early.

.OUTPUTS
    One JSON object on stdout: ok, step, exitCode, timedOut, seconds, command,
    workDir, stdout, stderr.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Invoke-AgentStep.ps1 -Step gate -Command '.\tools\Test-Examples.ps1'

.EXAMPLE
    # A failing step: ok=false, exitCode=1, and the reason in stderr.
    .\Invoke-AgentStep.ps1 -Step build -Command '.\tools\New-Project.ps1 -Spec .\examples\missing.json'
