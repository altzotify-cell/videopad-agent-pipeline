## 1. Goal

An agent pipeline that edits video unattended:

```
JSON edit spec  →  .vpj project  →  VideoPad  →  exported .mp4
```

No ffmpeg rendering, no screen recording, no NLE SDK — VideoPad itself is the
renderer, and the agent only supplies a project file plus a click.

## 2. Verdict: can an agent edit in VideoPad?

**Yes, with a precise scope.** Three separate questions hide inside that one:

| question | answer | why |
|---|---|---|
| Can a tool write a `.vpj` VideoPad will open and honour? | **Yes, proven** | `.vpj` is plain-text LF-terminated sectioned querystrings; a stale checksum only raises a "Damaged File" prompt that is auto-answerable |
| Can VideoPad be made to *export* that project unattended? | **Yes, proven** | ribbon coordinate clicks + `BM_CLICK` on the export dialog's `Create` button; output verified frame-by-frame |
| Can an agent perform *arbitrary* edits? | **Partly — v4** | the writer renames, trims, reorders, **reuses a source any number of times**, adds and removes clips, **adds new media files**, mutes segments, **splits a clip at arbitrary cut points**, writes **per-segment video effect chains** registered in `tools/effects.json`, and now **changes playback speed and fades clips in/out**. Not yet: transitions, titles, audio mixing. See §9 |

So: **the loop closes today for a cut** *and* for structural edits that only add
or remove timeline clips and bin media, *and* for split + effect chains, *and* for
speed/fade pacing. It does not yet cover transitions, titles or audio mixing.


There is **no scripting API**: VideoPad is a Delphi app with no MSAA/UIA
provider (all ~65 UIA descendants are unnamed `Pane`s). Everything below is
Win32 window enumeration + synthetic input, so it is inherently calibrated to a
window size and DPI. Treat the UI layer as the fragile part and the `.vpj`
writer as the durable part.

## 3. Environment (this machine — re-verify if anything looks off)

| item | value |
|---|---|
| VideoPad | Professional **8.91+**, 32-bit, `C:\Program Files (x86)\NCH Software\VideoPad\videopad.exe` |
| display | **150% scaling** (this is the source of the historical DPI bug, §7) |
| main window | 1536×817 physical px at the calibration used for ribbon coords |
| ffmpeg / ffprobe | `C:\Users\user\scoop\shims\ffmpeg.exe` (on PATH) |
| workspace | `C:\Users\user\Downloads\videopad` |
| template project | `C:\Users\user\Documents\probe.vpj` |
| autosave read-out | `%APPDATA%\NCH Software\VideoPad\autosave.vpj` |
| export presets | `%APPDATA%\NCH Software\VideoPad\ComputerPresets\*.dat` |

Source media in the template (two distinct sources, timeline order):

| index | handle | file |
|---|---|---|
| `source: 0` | media `h=327` | `One_Punch_Man_Season_3_Episode_2_1080p_@Tv_Series_ETY_.Mkv` (1 441 083 ms) |
| `source: 1` | media `h=345` | `One_Punch_Man_Season_3_Episode_3_1080p_@Tv_Series_ETY_.Mkv` (1 441 083 ms) |

The two episodes **share an identical opening**, which matters for verification:
any frame from the first ~90 s matches both sources, so content checks are only
conclusive past the opening (§8).

## 4. Pipeline and file map

| file | role |
|---|---|
| `examples/cut1.json` | the edit spec (template, output, sequence name, segments) |
| `examples/cut2-reuse.json`, `examples/cut3-addmedia.json` | v2 specs: source reuse / dropped clip / mute, and added media |
| `examples/cut4-split-effects.json` | v3 spec: `split`, `defaultEffects`, per-segment `effects` |
| `examples/cut5-cadence.json` | v4 spec: `speed`, `fadeIn`, `fadeOut` (plus a mirror so effects are seen to compose with speed) |
| `tools/effects.json` | **effect registry**: for each effect, its `id` (the value that goes in `typeN`), the blob VideoPad ships (`defaults`), named `presets`, and per-key metadata (number, enum, bool, keyframed). Keys were dumped from the live `HKCU:\…\VideoPad\EffectPresets` |
| `tools/New-Project.ps1` | **spec → .vpj** by editing the template; preserves unknown fields byte-for-byte |
| `tools/Test-Examples.ps1` | rebuilds every spec and asserts the output is **byte-identical** — the gate before a commit (no VideoPad needed) |
| `tools/Open-Project.ps1` | launches VideoPad on a `.vpj`, clears stale modals, auto-answers "Damaged File" via `WM_COMMAND/IDOK`; ~4.5 s |
| `tools/Watch-Autosave.ps1` | load → wait for autosave refresh → report what the parser actually absorbed |
| `tools/Compare-Vpj.ps1` | field-level diff of two `.vpj` files, records matched by handle — the check behind every "round-tripped unchanged" claim |
| `tools/Invoke-AgentStep.ps1` | runs one step in a child PowerShell and prints one JSON verdict `{ok, exitCode, timedOut, seconds, stdout, stderr}` — the agent contract |
| `tools/Export-Project.ps1` | **.vpj → .mp4**: ribbon clicks, `Create`, wait, adopt file, verify duration |
| `tools/PadUi.ps1` | UI primitives: DPI-aware capture/click, top-level window enumeration, control search, `BM_CLICK`, window resizing |
| `tools/NativeInput.cs` | P/Invoke layer (`mouse_event`, `keybd_event`, `SendMessage`, `EnumWindows`, …) |
| `tools/Probe-ExportDialog.ps1` | diagnostic: dumps the control map of whatever dialog is under a point |
| `tools/Get-WindowCapture.ps1`, `tools/Send-PadClick.ps1` | earlier standalone capture / click tools, still useful for calibration |
| `docs/vpj-format-findings.md` | format reference: sections, handles, checksum, timeline semantics, export |
| `docs/AGENT-RUNBOOK.md` | operating manual for driving the pipeline from an agent: loop, costs, failure taxonomy, invariants |
| `agent/tools.json` | the same pipeline as seven functions with JSON-Schema arguments, for a tool-calling loop or an MCP server |
| `agent/system-prompt.md` | paste-ready agent contract: rules, loop, budgets, reporting format |
| `agent/Invoke-PadTool.ps1` | fills one `tools.json` template (applies defaults, derives computed args, refuses shell metacharacters) and runs it through the runner |
| `RUN-IT.md` | copy-paste, press-Enter walkthrough for someone who has never used PowerShell, with the exact output of every step |
| `out/cut1.vpj`, `out/cut2-reuse.vpj`, `out/cut3-addmedia.vpj` | the generated projects (210 000 / 150 000 / 36 000 ms) |
| `out/cut4-split-effects.vpj` | v3 project: 15 000 ms, 6 clips from 3 segments (one split in three, one split in two) + effect chains |
| `out/cut5-cadence.vpj` | v4 project: 13 500 ms, 4 clips (2×, 1×, 0.5×, 2× with a chain), three keyframed fades |
| `out/agent-cut-v2.mp4`, `out/agent-cut-first-export.mp4` | the two verified 210 s exports (identical) |
| `out/cut3-addmedia.mp4`, `out/cut4-effects.mp4`, `out/cut5-cadence.mp4` | the v2, v3 and v4 exports (gitignored) |

| `out/oracle/` | evidence: v2/v3/v4 autosave round-trips, watcher logs, export logs, frame-MAE scripts and results (`cut3-verify.*`, `cut4-verify.*`, `cut5-verify.*`), the `v4-probe/` experiment set, and `compare-projects.ps1` (timelines + chains, human-readable) — pair it with `tools/Compare-Vpj.ps1` for a field-level diff |

End-to-end invocation, in order:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\user\Downloads\videopad

# 0. regression gate (~2 s, no VideoPad): every spec must reproduce its .vpj exactly
.\tools\Test-Examples.ps1

# 1. spec -> project
.\tools\New-Project.ps1 -Spec .\examples\cut1.json

# 2. cheap content check (~5 s, no encode)
.\tools\Watch-Autosave.ps1 -Project .\out\cut1.vpj -LogPath .\logs\autosave-check.log

# 3. render (drives the UI, ~7 min for 3.5 min of 1080p)
.\tools\Export-Project.ps1 -ProjectPath .\out\cut1.vpj `
    -OutputPath .\out\agent-cut.mp4 -ExpectedDurationMs 210000

# 3b. if the click phase already started an encode and you lost the process:
.\tools\Export-Project.ps1 -OutputPath .\out\agent-cut.mp4 `
    -ExpectedDurationMs 210000 -WaitOnly
```

`Export-Project.ps1` parameters:

| param | meaning |
|---|---|
| `-OutputPath` (required) | where the finished mp4 must end up |
| `-ProjectPath` | open this project first (delegates to `Open-Project.ps1`); omit to use whatever is open |
| `-ExpectedDurationMs` | asserts the result within ±42 ms (one frame at 23.976); `0` skips |
| `-ExportFolder` | folder VideoPad writes into. The *dialog* inherits the project's `Computer_FilePath` (usually `%USERPROFILE%\Videos`); the *tool* defaults to `%USERPROFILE%\Videos` if not given |
| `-TimeoutSeconds` | whole-run budget, default 1800 |
| `-WaitOnly` | skip all clicks, adopt the newest export in `-ExportFolder` (recovery path) |

## 5. The `.vpj` format in one screen

Plain text, LF line endings, one record per line, each line a querystring of
`key=value&key=value`. Lines are grouped into named sections; a record's identity
is its handle, **not** its line position.

| `type=` | record | key fields |
|---|---|---|
| 1 / 2 | video / audio track | `h`, `htrack` |
| 3 / 5 | video / audio media (source) | `h`, `name`, `out` (source length, ms) |
| 6 | sequence | `h`, `name`, `duration`, `in`, `out` |
| 7 | trackclip | `h`, `htrack`, `horiginalclip`, `hlinked`, `offset`, `in`, `out` |

Semantics that matter when writing:

- `in`/`out` on a trackclip = trim window **inside the source** (ms); `offset` =
  position **on the timeline** (ms). With `speedchangef≠1` the window is
  *speed-scaled* — source = `(in + t) × speed`, see "Speed and fades" in
  `docs/vpj-format-findings.md`.
- A source's video and audio are **two separate `type=7` records** joined by
  `hlinked` — trim them identically or A/V drifts.
- Sequence `duration`/`out` must equal the **exact sum** of `(out - in)` over its
  trackclips (the sample's 2 × 1 441 083 = 2 882 166 to the millisecond).
- `effectchains` has exactly one line per clip/sequence/media handle, which is why
  adding a handle is not just "add a line".
- The last line is `checksum=…`. **Do not reverse-engineer it** — leave it stale.
  VideoPad then shows "Damaged File / Try Load", which `Open-Project.ps1` answers
  in ~4 s. (This is the single biggest time-saver in the whole project.)
- The file stores **paths, not media**. Missing files resolve offline.

## 6. The writer: spec schema and guard rails

```json
{
  "template": "probe.vpj",
  "output":   "../out/cut4-split-effects.vpj",
  "sequenceName": "Split + Effect Test",
  "media":    [ { "id": "bars", "path": "../out/testmedia/bars.mp4" } ],
  "defaultEffects": [ { "name": "saturation", "preset": "Completely Unsaturated" } ],
  "segments": [
    { "source": 1,      "start": 0,      "end": 6000,   "split": [ 2000, 4000 ] },
    { "source": "bars", "start": 0,      "end": 6000,   "split": [ 3000 ],
      "effects": [ { "name": "rotate", "params": { "z": 90 } } ] },
    { "source": 1,      "start": 900000, "end": 903000,
      "effects": [ { "name": "mirror", "params": { "mirrordirection": "vertical" } },
                   { "name": "colorAdjust", "preset": "Bright", "params": { "contrast": 60 } } ] }
  ]
}
```

- `source` is either an integer index into the template's distinct sources **in
  timeline order**, or the `id` of an entry in `media`. `start`/`end` are ms
  inside that source; `mute` is optional.
- Segment order *is* timeline order, so the list doubles as a reorder, a drop
  (omit a source) and a reuse (repeat one).
- `split` is a list of **absolute ms inside the source** (not offsets into the
  segment) that must lie strictly between `start` and `end`. It expands into
  adjacent segments sharing one media handle and one effect chain, which is
  exactly how VideoPad stores a split (no special "split" record exists).
- `effects` is that segment's video effect chain; `defaultEffects` is inherited by
  every segment that does not define `effects`. An **explicit `[]` means "no
  effects"** and does override `defaultEffects`. Audio is unaffected — an audio
  clip's chain is the empty default, as the app writes it.
- An effect entry is `{ "name": <key in tools/effects.json>, "preset": <name>, "params": { … } }`.
  `preset` fills the blob from the registry, then `params` overrides only the keys
  given; `params` alone starts from the effect's `defaults`. Overriding a
  keyframed parameter group (`keys!=0`) is refused rather than silently discarded.
- `sequenceName` is optional and URL-encoded into the sequence record.
- `speed` (number, default 1) changes playback rate: 2 halves the clip's timeline
  length, 0.5 doubles it. **`in`/`out` are written divided by the speed**, because
  the app reads source = position × speed (see
  `docs/vpj-format-findings.md` → "Speed and fades"). A segment that would need
  `out > mediaDuration/speed` is **rejected**, since VideoPad silently clamps
  there and every later clip would shift.
- `fadeIn` / `fadeOut` (ms) ramp the clip from/to black. They are written as a
  keyframed Fade (opacity) slot appended after the segment's own effects; the app
  only ships whole-clip fades, so partial fades need keyframes. Fades that
  overlap each other or exceed the clip are rejected.
- **All paths resolve against the spec's own folder** unless absolute, so a spec
  is portable between checkouts.
- `media` entries are measured with `ffprobe` — supply `"duration"` (ms) to skip
  that. A file without an audio stream is rejected: added media is written as an
  A/V pair and the audio-less variant has not been verified.

What `New-Project.ps1` does:

- trims `in`/`out` on the video **and** linked audio trackclip, rewrites `offset`
  cumulatively from 0, sets sequence `duration`/`out` to the exact sum;
- **reuses** a template trackclip pair when the segment's source still has an
  unused one, so a spec that never repeats a source rewrites the file in place
  (byte-identical to the v1 output — `examples/cut1.json` still reproduces
  `out/cut1.vpj` exactly);
- otherwise **allocates** a fresh `type=7` video/audio handle pair from `hindex`,
  bumps `hindex`, and clones the pair from the template's own prototype line;
- **expands `split`** into consecutive segments before anything else runs, so a
  cut point is just two adjacent clips — VideoPad shows it as a split (same media
  handle, touching offsets) and nothing downstream needs to know;
- **writes effect chains**: resolves each segment's `effects`/`defaultEffects`
  through `tools/effects.json`, then rewrites the `size`/`typeN`/`presetN`/`dataN`
  slots of that clip's `effectchains` record (found by its `hclip`). Everything
  else in the record — fades, speed, `hclip` itself — is preserved field by field;
- **removes** the trackclip *and* `effectchains` records of clips no longer used,
  so nothing is orphaned on the timeline (bin media records are kept, matching
  what the app does when a clip is deleted);
- **adds** a `type=5`/`type=3` media pair plus one `effectchains` line per handle
  for every new file; segments of the same added media share that one record;
- **sets speed** on both records of a clip's video/audio pair and lays the
  timeline out from the speed-scaled lengths, so offsets stay contiguous;
- **appends a fade slot** for `fadeIn`/`fadeOut`, with keyframe positions as
  fractions of the clip's own (post-speed) length;
- refuses trims past source length, and **asserts**: every handle unique, exactly
  one `effectchains` record per clip handle, section counts consistent with their
  bodies, and the checksum line untouched — so a format drift fails loudly
  instead of producing a subtly broken project.

It returns one summary object — `Output`, `DurationMs`, `SequenceName`,
`SourceCount`, `SegmentCount` (after split expansion), `DroppedClips`,
`AllocatedHandles`, `MediaAdded`, `EffectCount`, and `Clips` with each clip's
handles and resolved chain — which is what `Test-Examples.ps1` prints next to its
byte comparison.

It works by editing a known-good template and reassembling by section, so every
field nobody understands survives byte-for-byte (including the glued
`Type=2SubtitlesExport=1` quirk and the stray CR).

## 7. UI automation: the rules that took the longest to learn

**R1 — DPI awareness before any coordinate.** PowerShell is DPI-unaware by
default: `GetWindowRect` returns *logical* px while `BitBlt`/`SetCursorPos` use
*physical* px. At 150% every click was displaced by half a screen and every
capture was cropped to the window's top-left ⅔. Call `SetProcessDPIAware()` first
(`PadUi.ps1` does). A long-standing note in this repo claimed "mouse clicks are
blocked by the Windows foreground lock" — **that was wrong**, it was DPI.

**R2 — Dialogs are owned popups, not children.** `GetParent` on a dialog control
returns the *owner*, so a dialog looks like a descendant, but
`EnumChildWindows(main)` never reaches it. Enumerate process **top-level** windows
(`Get-PadWindows`).

**R3 — Ribbon is custom-drawn, dialogs are not.** The ribbon has no HWNDs and no
UIA → coordinate clicks only. The export dialog is a `DirectUIHWND` (embedded IE)
inside a `NativeHWNDHost` popup, but its buttons are **real Win32 `Button`s with
window text** → find by name and `BM_CLICK`. A synthetic *mouse* click on `Create`
is silently swallowed; `BM_CLICK` works; `Enter` also works (default button).

**R4 — The export dropdown is transient.** Home → Export Video → Video File must
be three clicks **inside one process**. A tool round-trip between them lets the
menu auto-close and the next click lands on the ribbon — that failure mode
silently changed the active tab to Sequence, then Effects, and opened a Text
Effects gallery. If the ribbon looks "possessed", this is why.

**R5 — Coordinate frame.** Ribbon coords were calibrated at **1536×817** physical:
Home `(175,66)`, Export Video `(543,105)`, Video File `(515,176)`.
`Export-Project.ps1` now **resizes the window to 1536×817** (`Set-PadWindowSize`)
before clicking. Scaling the coordinates by `window.Width / 1536` alone is not
enough: the ribbon scales with **DPI, not with window width**, so on a maximised
1942×1030 window every width-scaled click lands *below* the ribbon and the Export
dropdown never opens (seen live — the driver waited out its timeout for a dialog
that never appeared). Recalibrate if the DPI changes; capture a screenshot with
`Save-PadCapture` and read coords off the **physical** image.

**R6 — Single instance, and never force-kill.** VideoPad silently **drops the file
argument** if another instance is already running — close first via `WM_CLOSE`.
Force-killing arms crash recovery ("Abnormal Termination"), which then suppresses
the CLI argument on the next start and poisons the next several runs.

**R7 — `WM_CLOSE` is swallowed while a modal is open.** Dismiss the modal first —
and note that each swallowed `WM_CLOSE` spawns *another* prompt, so a naive retry
loop leaves a stack of identical dialogs. `Open-Project.ps1` answers them
(`Clear-PadModals`) before closing. The ones seen in practice:

| modal | buttons | answer |
|---|---|---|
| "The current project has been changed since the last time you saved…" | `Save` `Discard` `Cancel` | **Discard** (one per swallowed close) |
| "New media has been connected to your computer." | `Add Files` `No` | **No** (raised when files land in a watched folder — e.g. our own export) |
| "Damaged File … try to load it anyway?" | `Try Load` `Cancel` | **Try Load** via `WM_COMMAND/IDOK`, never `Cancel` |

These are **real `#32770` windows with real `Button` children, but UI Automation
does not expose them at all** — not the window, not the buttons. `Clear-PadModals`
therefore enumerates with Win32 (`Get-PadWindows` + `EnumChildWindows`) and never
answers anything whose text mentions "damaged".

**R8 — The encode happens inside VideoPad.** The calling script is not the renderer,
so an interrupted script does not lose the render: `-WaitOnly` adopts the newest
export. The mp4 is unreadable until the `moov` atom is written (`ffprobe` says
`moov atom not found` mid-encode); completion = size stopped changing **and**
ffprobe returns a duration.

**R9 — Output naming cannot be set.** The dialog's text fields are inside the
DirectUI tree. VideoPad **never overwrites**: an existing target becomes
`Name 1.mp4`. Hence the tool snapshots the folder, adopts the new/changed file,
moves it to `-OutputPath`, then dismisses the completion dialog (its `Close`
button is found by name).

**R10 — Run the UI-driving scripts in a console you can see, and clear modals
before anything else.** A hidden / detached `Start-Process powershell -File …`
launched from another PowerShell session produced *no window enumeration and no
clicks at all* — the script appeared to run and did nothing. Whatever the cause
(session/desktop or job-object teardown), the reliable patterns are (a) run
`Export-Project.ps1` in the interactive console, or (b) if you must detach, create
the process with `Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName Win32_Process -MethodName Create`
and point its stdout/stderr at a log file, then poll the log — that is how the
`cut4` export was driven. Related: after a killed VideoPad the next start raises
**"Abnormal Termination Detected"** (an "unexpectedly terminated" report dialog)
that swallows clicks on the ribbon until dismissed; treat it like any other modal
(`Get-PadWindows` + `WM_COMMAND`/`IDOK`) instead of force-killing the app again.

**R11 — Find prompts by their buttons, not by their names.** The "Damaged File"
prompt's window text is empty whenever a second prompt stacks on the first, and
`Clear-PadModals` used to answer the leftover one with `[Cancel]` — which
silently throws the load away, leaving an empty "Untitled" sequence that looks
exactly like a corrupt project. `Open-Project.ps1` now looks for a real Win32
`Button` whose text is `Try Load` on any top-level window and activates it with
`BM_CLICK`. Two details cost real time: `WM_COMMAND`/`IDOK` must be posted to the
**dialog**, not to the button (posting to the button is accepted and does
nothing — it produced 26 unanswered prompts), and a prompt whose button set is
`[It Crashed] [Something Else]` means the app is in crash recovery and has
already dropped the file argument, so the only useful answer is to report it.

## 8. Evidence the pipeline is real (not "the export dialog opened")

Two independent oracles, deliberately: one for *what VideoPad parsed*, one for
*what came out the far end*.

**Oracle A — autosave (`tools/Watch-Autosave.ps1`).** VideoPad rewrites
`%APPDATA%\NCH Software\VideoPad\autosave.vpj` ~3 s after a load, as a full
re-serialization of its in-memory model. A project we wrote and the app's own
re-emission differ on **exactly three lines**: `hindex`, one folder `open=` UI
flag, and `checksum`. `thumbpos` was also recomputed (1 440 000 → 100 000), which
proves the app *rebuilt* the timeline from our values instead of echoing the file
back. That is how content fidelity was confirmed cheaply, without rendering.

**Oracle B — exported frames.** `ffmpeg -ss <t> -frames:v 1 -vf scale=32:32,format=gray`
on both the export and the sources, then mean absolute error (0 ≈ identical,
70+ ≈ unrelated).

Spec under test: `source 1` 0–90 000 ms, then `source 0` 60 000–180 000 ms →
expected 210 000 ms.

| check | result |
|---|---|
| duration | **210.005751 s** vs 210.000 requested → 5.8 ms ≈ 0.14 frame |
| streams | 1920×1080 h264 + AAC, 5036 frames @ 23.976 |
| size | 178 212 640 bytes |
| determinism | two runs **byte-identical**, SHA256 `FDCA15802A463E3E7D0BF63AFF595E2E76013E8B6D7353891E48D31FB13CB16D` |
| export@91 s vs Ep2@61 s | **0.23** ← match (91−90 = 1 s into segment 2, in-point 60 s) |
| export@91 s vs Ep3@91 s | 73.67 ← control |
| export@91 s vs Ep2@91 s | 73.64 ← control |
| export@200 s vs Ep2@170 s | **0.18** ← match (200−90 = 110 s + 60 s in-point) |
| export@200 s vs Ep3@170 s | 79.08 ← control |

Read the matches backwards: they pin the **switch at exactly 90 000 ms**, because
the match only holds at `t − 90 000 + source in-point`.

**Honest limitation:** `export@86 s` matches *both* sources (0.23 / 0.26), because
the two episodes share an identical opening. Frames therefore **cannot**
distinguish Ep3 from Ep2 inside the first 90 s. What is provable there is the
segment's 90 s length and that the switch lands at 90 s — not which episode fills
it. Segment 2 is conclusively Ep2.

Reproduce the frame check:

```powershell
$t=91
& ffmpeg -v error -ss $t -i .\out\agent-cut-v2.mp4 -frames:v 1 -vf scale=32:32,format=gray -f rawvideo -y out\a.gray

### v2 evidence (structure *and* new media)

Both v2 features were checked against both oracles, and the artefacts are in
`out/oracle/`:

| project | what it proves | result |
|---|---|---|
| `out/cut2-reuse.vpj` (5 clips, one source used 3×, 3 allocated pairs, one muted) | source reuse + drop + mute survive the parser | autosave returned all 10 trackclips **byte-identical** (handle, `horiginalclip`, `htrack`, `offset`, `in`, `out`), `clips=5 / trackclips=10 / effectchains=15`, `mute=1` kept. Only deltas: checksum, `hindex`, folder `open=`, recomputed `thumb` |
| `out/cut3-addmedia.vpj` (Ep3 0–15 s, `bars.mp4` 0–6 s, Ep3 900–915 s) | added media + reuse + trim, end to end | autosave: `clips=7 / trackclips=6 / effectchains=13`, all 6 clips identical, and the two synthesised media records identical **down to field order and `creationtime`**. Export: **36.011 s** vs 36.000 expected (Δ 11 ms) |

Frame MAE for the export (`out/oracle/cut3-verify.ps1` → `.txt`):

| comparison | MAE | reading |
|---|---|---|
| `export@18s` vs `bars@3s` | **0.59** | the added media really is on screen, at the right source time |
| `export@18s` vs `Ep3@5s` | 97.41 | …and it is not the episode |
| `export@5s` vs `Ep3@5s` | **0.20** | segment 1 correct (`Ep2@5s` = 1.04: shared opening) |
| `export@30s` vs `Ep3@909s` | **0.42** | segment 3's `in=900000` is exact |
| `export@30s` vs `Ep3@5s` | 121.23 | …and unrelated to the episode's opening |

Regenerate the scratch clip the add-media example points at:

```powershell
ffmpeg -y -f lavfi -i "testsrc2=size=640x360:rate=25:duration=6" `
       -f lavfi -i "sine=frequency=440:duration=6" `
       -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -shortest out\testmedia\bars.mp4
```

### v3 evidence (split + effect chains)

Spec `examples/cut4-split-effects.json` → `out/cut4-split-effects.vpj`: 15 000 ms,
3 spec segments expanding to **6 clips**, `defaultEffects` on every segment,
one segment overriding with its own chain:

| timeline (ms) | source | chain actually written |
|---|---|---|
| 0–2 000 / 2 000–4 000 / 4 000–6 000 | Ep3 (one clip, `split [2000, 4000]`) | `type=24` saturation `value=-100` — inherited `defaultEffects` |
| 6 000–9 000 / 9 000–12 000 | `bars.mp4` (`split [3000]`) | `type=33` rotate `z=90` — explicit `effects`, and the frame stays **colourful**, so it replaced the default rather than appending to it |
| 12 000–15 000 | Ep3 @ 900 000 | `type=36` mirror `mirrordirection=1` **and** `type=6` colour `contrast=60` |

**Oracle A — autosave round-trip** (`out/oracle/cut4-split-effects.roundtrip.vpj`,
differ with `tools/Compare-Vpj.ps1 -A out/cut4-split-effects.vpj -B …`; for a
readable dump of timelines and chains use `out/oracle/compare-projects.ps1`):
all 6 video/audio pairs came back with identical `h`, `hlinked`, `in`, `out`,
`offset` — the split survived as three and two adjacent clips sharing one media
handle, which is exactly how the app itself stores a split. All six chains came
back slot-for-slot identical (`size`, `typeN`, `dataN`).

Two deltas, both benign, both worth knowing:

- **line order**: the app emits all video trackclips, then all audio. Pure
  re-serialisation; the format keys off handles, not line positions.
- **`presetN` is re-derived.** `rotate`/`mirror`/`colour` came back as
  `preset=Custom` instead of `Default Preset`/`Bright`, because our params no
  longer equal the shipped preset. Saturation kept
  `preset=Completely Unsaturated` because `value=-100` *is* that preset. So the
  app validates `dataN` against the preset table and relabels accordingly —
  **diff `dataN`, never `presetN`**, and never expect a preset *name* to round-trip
  once you override a single parameter.

**Oracle B — export** `out/cut4-effects.mp4`: 15.019 s vs 15 000 (Δ 19 ms ≈ 0.5
frame), 7 461 497 bytes, 1920×1080 h264 + AAC. Numbers from
`out/oracle/cut4-verify.ps1` (output in `cut4-verify.txt`):

| claim | measurement | reading |
|---|---|---|
| clips 0–2 are desaturated | mean chroma `0.0` at t = 1 / 3 / 5 s vs **33.4** on Ep3@5 s; frame MAE export@5 vs Ep3@5 = **4.06** | same picture, colour removed — MAE 4 is as close as a deliberate effect gets |
| clips 3–4 are rotated | export@7 vs `bars@1` **transposed ccw = 46.86**, cw = 99.26, as-is = 95.49 | the 90° turn is there and it is the right way round; the residual is the pillarbox crop at 32×32 |
| …and keep their colour | chroma export@7 = **133.1** vs source 226.3 | `effects` overrode `defaultEffects`; had it been inherited the export would have been grey |
| clip 6 is mirrored | export@13 vs **its own L-R mirror = 0.19**, vs its own T-B mirror = 152.91; the unmirrored source scores **35.69** against its own L-R mirror | left-right symmetric, and the source is not — mirror active, axis = vertical. (`effects.json`'s "vertical" means *mirror across the vertical axis*, i.e. a horizontal flip.) |
| …and contrast-boosted | frame is visibly blown out; MAE against the mirror-flipped source is ~64 for both flipped and unflipped, i.e. luma was rescaled too much for MAE to arbitrate | read from the frames, not the metric |

The saturation check is the one that needs care: Ep3's opening 0–4 s is a
pencil-sketch title card that is *already* near-grey (source chroma 2.0 / 1.7), so
t = 1 s and t = 3 s prove nothing on their own. Only t = 5 s, where the source
chroma is 33.4 and the export's is 0.0, separates "effect applied" from "source
was grey".

Sampling times follow from the spec, not from guessing: clip 3 starts at timeline
6 000 with `in=0`, so export@7 s is `bars@1 s`; clip 6 starts at 12 000 with
`in=900000`, so export@13 s is `Ep3@901 s`.

### v4 evidence (speed + fades)

Spec `examples/cut5-cadence.json` → `out/cut5-cadence.vpj`: 13 500 ms, 4 clips.

| timeline (ms) | written as | why |
|---|---|---|
| 0–3 000 | `in=0 out=3000`, `speedchangef=2.000000` on both records, Fade `keys=3` at positions 0 / 0.083333 / 1 | `bars` 0–6 000 at 2× — 6 s of source in a 3 s slot; 250 ms fade-in = 250/3000 of the clip |
| 3 000–6 000 | `in=1000 out=4000`, Fade `keys=3` at 0 / 0.833333 / 1 | 500 ms fade-out, position 1 − 500/3000 |
| 6 000–12 000 | `in=0 out=6000`, `speedchangef=0.500000` | `bars` 0–3 000 at half speed |
| 12 000–13 500 | `in=1500 out=3000`, `speedchangef=2.000000`, Mirror + Fade `keys=4` at 0 / 0.133333 / 0.866667 / 1 | `bars` 3 000–6 000 at 2×, so `in` is 3000/2; 200 ms fades on a 1500 ms clip |

**Oracle A — autosave round-trip** (`out/oracle/cut5-cadence.roundtrip.vpj`): the
only differences are `thumb`/`thumbpos` on the sequence record, which the app
always zeroes. Every `in`/`out`/`offset`, both `speedchangef` values of each pair,
all four keyframe groups and the mirror slot came back untouched — in particular
the app did **not** re-clamp `out`, which is what the writer's guard exists to
prevent.

**Oracle B — export** `out/cut5-cadence.mp4`: 13.534 s vs 13 500 (Δ 34 ms),
2 245 767 bytes. Every number below is reproduced by
`out/oracle/cut5-verify.ps1` (output in `cut5-verify.txt`); source frames are
matched by 32×32 greyscale MAE, the same method `cut4-verify.ps1` uses, so speed
is *measured* rather than inferred from the burnt-in timecode (which was read
visually as a second opinion):

| claim | measurement | reading |
|---|---|---|
| clip 1 plays at 2× | export@2.9 s vs `bars@5.8` = **0.69**; vs `bars@2.9` = 7.48 | 3 s into a 2× clip is source 5.8 s, not 2.9 s |
| clip 3 plays at 0.5× | export@8.5 s vs `bars@1.25` = **2.39**; vs `bars@2.5` = 5.78 | 2.5 s into a half-speed clip is source 1.25 s |
| `in` is speed-scaled | export@12.5 s vs `bars@4.0` = **1.67**; vs `bars@2.0` = 9.05 | clip 4 has `in=1500`; source is (1500+500)×2 = 4.0 s, not 2.0 s |
| clip 4 keeps its effect | export@12.5 vs `bars@4.0` half-mirrored = **1.67**, vs unflipped = 53.99 | the chain still applies while the clip is sped up |

Fades, as mean luma of the 32×32 frame: clip 1 climbs **5.3 → 67.1 → 126.8**
across its 250 ms and holds at 126.8; clip 2 falls **125.0 → 44.3 → 2.4** across
its last 500 ms; clip 4 is dark at 12.05 s (37.9), reaches 144.9 by 12.4 s and is
back to 20.3 at 13.45 s as its 200 ms fade-out finishes.

While measuring clip 4, the mirror's *default* direction turned out not to be a
flip at all: `mirrordirection=0` keeps the left half and reflects it onto the
right (a half mirror), so `bars@4.0` matches it at MAE 1.67 while plain
hflip/vflip/unflipped all sit at 54-58. `mirrordirection=1` — what cut4 used — is
the plain horizontal flip.

**Guard rails, exercised:** a 1000 ms segment with `fadeIn 800`+`fadeOut 800`
fails with *"fades 800+800 ms but the clip is only 1000 ms long"*; `speed: 0`
fails with *"has speed 0; it must be greater than 0"*. Both refuse before a byte
of project is written.

**What the probes ruled out** (all in `out/oracle/v4-probe/`, same recipe in §8):

- `fadeinduration` on the trackclip is **not** a fade length — the app resets it
  to 0 on load, so a fade must be an effect-chain keyframe group instead.
- `voll`/`volr` on a clip's effectchains record round-trip verbatim but change
  nothing in the render: six segments exported at −3.4 dB whether they carried
  `50`, `-6` or `0`.
- Setting `fadepoints=2` makes the app materialise a full fade model
  (`fadetype0/1`, `pos0/1`, `volume0/1`) — a real format, but with zeroed points
  it has no audible effect, and the units are still unverified.
- effect 28 (the `fade` entry in `tools/effects.json`) applied to the **audio**
  chain survives the round-trip and is silently ignored at render time: it is
  video opacity. This is why `fadeIn`/`fadeOut` are documented as picture fades.

### v5 evidence (flip / lateral inversion)

Spec `examples/cut6-flip.json` → `out/cut6-flip.vpj`: 12 000 ms, 5 clips from one
6 s asymmetric source (`out/testmedia/asym.mp4`, 640×360) covering all four values
of the new segment key.

| timeline (ms) | written as | why |
|---|---|---|
| 0–3 000 | `type0=69`, `horzflip=value=1`, `vertflip=value=0` | lateral inversion |
| 3 000–6 000 | `horzflip=value=0`, `vertflip=value=1` | upside down |
| 6 000–9 000 | the `both` slot on **both** halves of `split: [1500]` | the key is inherited like `effects`/`fadeIn` |
| 9 000–12 000 | `flip: "none"` → `size=0` chain | the no-op is expressible, and is the control |

**Oracle — export** `out/cut6-flip.mp4`: 12.010 s vs 12 000 (Δ 10 ms),
2 285 251 bytes, SHA256 `F8C8C0B0…2B903A`. Every number below is reproduced by
`out/oracle/cut6-verify.ps1` (output in `cut6-verify.txt`) — 32×32 greyscale MAE
against `asym` frames flipped with ffmpeg, the same method as `cut4`/`cut5`:

| clip | vs expected flip | vs hflip | vs vflip | vs h+v | vs unflipped |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| horizontal | **2.37** | 2.37 | 105.56 | 8.82 | 106.42 |
| vertical | **2.41** | 105.55 | 2.41 | 106.40 | 8.82 |
| both (6.75 s) | **0.67** | 8.56 | 106.22 | 0.67 | 106.22 |
| both (8.25 s) | **3.01** | 9.43 | 105.43 | 3.01 | 105.48 |
| none (10.5 s) | **1.93** | 106.94 | 8.59 | 106.08 | 1.93 |

Reading: the horizontal clip is 2.37 away from its own L-R mirror and 106 from
the unflipped source, so those pixels really are inverted left-right; the vertical
clip is the transpose of that result (2.41 vs its T-B mirror, 106 vs hflip); both
halves of the split pair match h+v, so the key survived the split; and `none`
sits at 1.93 against the unflipped source and 107 against hflip — the control that
says the metric can tell the difference at all.

Caveat worth keeping: `asym.mp4` is strongly L-R asymmetric (≈106 between a frame
and its mirror) but nearly T-B symmetric (≈8.6), so the horizontal claim is the one
this source proves hard; the vertical claim rests on *which* reference it matches
(2.41 vs 105.55), not on its distance from unflipped.

**Guard rail, exercised:** `"flip": "sideways"` fails with *\"Segment 1 for source
'asym' has flip 'sideways'; expected horizontal (left<->right), vertical
(top<->bottom), both, or none.\"* and no project file is written.

**Why a key and not an effect:** effect 69 (`flip`) was already in
`tools/effects.json`, so nothing *new* is possible that wasn't before — the change
is that a spec no longer has to discover that `{ "name": "mirror" }` defaults to
`mirrordirection=0` (a half mirror) and that `mirrordirection=1` is the actual
flip. `flip` says which way the picture ends up, and the two axes are independent,
so `both` (180°/point symmetry) is expressible in one slot.

### v6 evidence (per-clip audio gain)

Spec `examples/cut7-audio.json` → `out/cut7-audio.vpj`: 12 000 ms, 5 clips —
0 dB, −6 dB, −12 dB split in two, then `mute`.

| timeline (ms) | written as | why |
|---|---|---|
| 0–3 000 | audio record `size=1&type0=1001&data0=amplify=value=100.000000` | unity |
| 3 000–6 000 | `…value=87.543` | 100 + 2.0761 × (−6) |
| 6 000–9 000 | `…value=75.087` on **both** halves | −12 dB, inherited by the split |
| 9 000–12 000 | `mute=1`, audio chain `size=0` | the existing off switch |

**The units came first.** VideoPad's Amplify slider is not a percentage, so one
12 s probe export (`out/oracle/v5-probe/audio-ladder`) carried the slider at
0 / 25 / 50 / 75 / 100 / 125 / 150 / 200 and measured each:

| slider | 0 | 25 | 50 | 75 | 100 | 125 | 150 | 200 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| mean dB vs 100 | silent | −36.1 | −24.0 | −12.1 | 0 | +0.1 | 0 | +0.1 |

That is a dB control: **0.4816 dB per unit**, 12.5 units per 6 dB, i.e.
`value = 100 + 2.0761 × dB`. A percentage would have put 50 at −6 dB; it is at
−24. My first cut of this feature wrote percent straight into the slider and was
wrong by 18 dB — the numbers, not the reasoning, caught it.

**Boosts do not exist in this pipeline.** 125, 150 and 200 are indistinguishable
from 100 because the exporter normalises peaks to full scale: a project with *no*
audio effect at all exports at −3.2 dB mean against a source that measures
−21.1 (a +17.9 dB lift), so the peaks already sit on 0 dBFS and more gain only
clips. That is why `audioGainDb` rejects positive values instead of pretending.

**Oracle — export** `out/cut7-audio.mp4`: 12.028 s vs 12 000 (Δ 28 ms),
1 262 526 bytes, SHA256 `DA65EAB6…890CEC`. Reproduced by
`out/oracle/cut7-verify.ps1` (`cut7-verify.txt`), `volumedetect` over 0.6–1 s
windows:

| clip | mean dB | vs control | asked |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 dB (control) | −3.2 | 0 | 0 |
| −6 dB | −9.3 | **−6.1** | −6 |
| −12 dB | −15.2 | **−12.0** | −12 |
| −12 dB, second half | −16.1 | −12.9 | −12 |
| `mute` | −91 | −87.8 | silence |

The remaining 0.1–0.9 dB is content, not conversion: the two halves of the −12 dB
clip are different 1.5 s of source, and a 32×32-style window mean is not a
loudness meter.

**Guard rails, exercised:** `audioGainDb: 3` → *"only attenuation is meaningful
… slider 125, 150 and 200 are all 0 dB against 100"*; `-99` → *"below the range
this writer accepts"*; `"loud"` → *"not a number of decibels"*; `0` and `-6`
build normally.

### v7 evidence (audio fades)

Spec `examples/cut8-audiofade.json` → `out/cut8-audiofade.vpj`: 12 000 ms, 4
clips of 3 s — no keys, `audioFadeIn 800`, `audioFadeOut 800`, then
`audioGainDb -6` with 500/500 fades.

| timeline (ms) | written as | why |
|---|---|---|
| 0–3 000 | audio chain `size=0` | control |
| 3 000–6 000 | `keys=3`: (0, 0) (0.266667, 100) (1, 100) | 800 ms of a 3 s clip = 0.266667 |
| 6 000–9 000 | `keys=3`: (0, 100) (0.733333, 100) (1, 0) | 1 − 800/3000 |
| 9 000–12 000 | `keys=4`: (0, 0) (0.166667, 87.543) (0.833333, 87.543) (1, 0) | plateau carries −6 dB; one slot, not a gain plus a fade |

**A bare number silences the clip.** The first attempt wrote
`amplify=0.000000&userdata=0&keys=3&…`; every faded clip then exported at
−91 dB at *every* probe, plateau included. A wrapped parameter's value is itself
an escaped keyframe group — the static slot stores
`amplify=value%3D100.000000%26userdata%3D0%26keys%3D0`, and the keyframed one must
be `amplify=` + the escaped group. Caught by measuring a plateau that should have
been loud, not by reading the file.

**Oracle — export** `out/cut8-audiofade.mp4`: 12.028 s vs 12 000 (Δ 28 ms),
1 231 855 bytes, SHA256 `B415FEF2…CD70E1`, `out/oracle/cut8-verify.ps1`
(`cut8-verify.txt`), 0.15 s `volumedetect` windows, dB against the control clip:

| clip | probes (s → dB) | reading |
|---|---|---|
| no keys (control) | 1.50 → −3.1 | reference |
| `audioFadeIn 800` | 3.10 → −14.3, 3.40 → −5.1, 3.70 → −0.9, 3.90 → 0, 4.50 → −0.5 | rises over the ramp and holds at control level |
| `audioFadeOut 800` | 7.50 → 0, 8.30 → −2.0, 8.60 → −7.5, 8.85 → −17.9 | falls over the last 800 ms |
| `-6 dB` + 500/500 | 9.10 → −16.3, 9.40 → −7.2, 9.60 → −6.1, 10.50 → −6.3, 11.60 → −9.6, 11.85 → −19.7 | rises, plateaus at the requested −6 dB, falls |

**Interpolation is linear in amplitude, not in the slider.** Halfway through an
800 ms ramp the slider sits at ~44 and the level measures −5.1 dB, where a ramp
linear in slider units would give −27 and a dB-linear ramp about −24. Each
keyframe value is mapped through the same 0.4816 dB/unit curve as a static value,
and the ramp interpolates the resulting amplitudes (mid-ramp prediction −7.2 dB
before window smear, measured −5.1). That is the usual constant-gain fade; a fade
that is linear in dB, which many editors offer, would need many keyframes.

**Guard rails, exercised:** `audioFadeIn: -1` → *"has a negative audio fade
length"*; 2000+2000 ms on a 3000 ms clip → *"fades audio 2000+2000 ms but the
clip is only 3000 ms long"*.

## 10. What is NOT supported yet (and the shape of the fix)

**Writer — still needs records this writer does not model:**

- **transitions** between clips (`transitions` section — not even inventoried yet),
- **titles** (the `Type=2SubtitlesExport=1` quirk is in every file, but no title
  record has been authored),
- **audio effects / mixing** — per-clip *level* (`audioGainDb`) and *fades*
  (`audioFadeIn`/`audioFadeOut`) are written now, and `mute` predates them, but
  that is all: no pan, no other audio effect (reverb, EQ, compressor are in the
  registry but uncatalogued here), and no second audio track, so no music bed and
  no ducking. `voll`/`volr` and effectchains `fadepoints` stay dead ends (§8 v4).
  The **track** records carry `volume=100&pan=0`, which is where pan would start.
- **keyframed effect parameters** — the writer now *authors* keyframes for fades,
  but still refuses to merge an override into a group that already has `keys!=0`,
- adding media **without an audio stream** — added media is written as a
  `type=5`/`type=3` pair, so a silent video is currently rejected rather than
  guessed at,
- more than one video/audio track or a second sequence.

Mechanically, everything else is now done: handles above `hindex` with `hindex`
bumped, cloned `type=7` pairs, cloned `effectchains` per handle, consistent
`hlinked`, recomputed `offset`/`duration`, split expansion into adjacent clips,
and removal of the records belonging to dropped clips.

**Other open items:**

- **Presets can't be picked** — the picker is DirectUI. Workaround: author
  `%APPDATA%\NCH Software\VideoPad\ComputerPresets\*.dat`, which are plain
  querystrings (`EditOutput_Width=1280&…&VIDEO_CODEC_MP4=28&Type=4`), or set
  `Computer_Preset` in the project.
- **Output path/filename can't be typed** — see R9.
- **Checksum** — never reversed. Stale checksum + auto-answered prompt is the
  strategy; a real save round-trip could normalise it if a clean file is needed.
- **No concurrency** — single instance, global autosave file, so validation and
  export are serialised.
- **UI layer is calibrated** — different DPI/window size ⇒ recalibrate (§7 R5).
- **Encode speed** — ~7 min per 3.5 min of 1080p, no progress read-out, only size
  stability.

## 11. Current state (as of this handoff)

- `out/cut1.vpj` — v1 regression: 210 000 ms, sequence "Agent Cut", still
  byte-identical when regenerated by the v4 writer.
- `out/cut2-reuse.vpj` — v2 reuse/drop/mute: 150 000 ms, 5 clips from 2 sources,
  round-tripped through the app unchanged.
- `out/cut3-addmedia.vpj` — v2 add-media: 36 000 ms, exported to
  `out/cut3-addmedia.mp4` (16.5 MB, gitignored) and verified by frame MAE.
- `out/cut4-split-effects.vpj` — v3 split + effects: 15 000 ms, 3 spec segments
  → 6 clips, 3 distinct chains (7 effect slots). Round-tripped through the app
  (`out/oracle/cut4-split-effects.roundtrip.vpj`) and exported to
  `out/cut4-effects.mp4` (7.46 MB, Δ 19 ms), verified by chroma + symmetry +
  transpose comparison (§8, `out/oracle/cut4-verify.*`).
- `out/cut5-cadence.vpj` — v4 speed + fades: 13 500 ms, 4 clips (2×, 1×, 0.5×,
  2× with mirror), 4 effect slots including three keyframed fades.
  Round-tripped (`out/oracle/cut5-cadence.roundtrip.vpj`, only the thumbnail
  cache differs) and exported to `out/cut5-cadence.mp4` (2.25 MB, Δ 34 ms),
  verified by burnt-in timecode + luma ramps (§8).
- `out/cut6-flip.vpj` — v5 flip: 12 000 ms, 5 clips (horizontal, vertical, `both`
  split in two, `none` as the control), 4 slots of effect 69. Exported to
  `out/cut6-flip.mp4` (2.29 MB, Δ 10 ms) and verified by frame MAE against
  ffmpeg-flipped source frames (§8, v5 evidence).
- `out/cut7-audio.vpj` — v6 audio gain: 12 000 ms, 5 clips (0, −6, −12 dB with a
  split, then mute), 4 audio slots of effect 1001. Exported to
  `out/cut7-audio.mp4` (1.26 MB, Δ 28 ms) and verified with `volumedetect`
  (§8, v6 evidence).
- `out/cut8-audiofade.vpj` — v7 audio fades: 12 000 ms, 4 clips (control,
  `audioFadeIn 800`, `audioFadeOut 800`, `-6 dB` with 500/500), 3 keyframed audio
  slots. Exported to `out/cut8-audiofade.mp4` (1.23 MB, Δ 28 ms) and verified by
  windowed `volumedetect` (§8, v7 evidence).
- `tools/Test-Examples.ps1` reports **all 9 specs byte-identical** (the v7 writer
  still reproduces `cut1`…`cut7` exactly, plus the local-only
  `yourclip-copyright-safe.json`), so v7 is a superset.
- All `tools/*.ps1` and the `out/oracle/**/*.ps1` helpers parse clean (AST check).
- VideoPad is **left running**; `Open-Project.ps1` now clears stale modals first,
  so the next run does not get stuck on a "Save changes?" prompt.
- The user's `Videos` folder is clean again — VideoPad writes there by default
  when the project's `Computer_FilePath` points there, and
  `Export-Project.ps1` moves the file out afterwards. If an `out\*.mp4` ever goes
  missing, check `Videos` first (an interrupted run can leave the only copy
  there) and then check for a PowerShell alias collision: a helper function named
  `MV` silently resolves to `Move-Item`, which is how `out/cut6-flip.mp4` was
  once renamed to a stray file called `0.5`. Both copies hashed
  `F8C8C0B0…2B903A`, so two renders of one recipe are byte-identical.

Paste this to continue the work with full context:

> You are continuing an agent video-editing project in
> `C:\Users\user\Downloads\videopad`. Read `docs/HANDOFF.md` first (operational
> picture, verdict, gotchas, commands), then `docs/vpj-format-findings.md` for

> VideoPad `.vpj` and drives VideoPad's UI (DPI-aware synthetic clicks + `BM_CLICK`
> on the export dialog) to render an `.mp4` unattended. Proven: spec → `.vpj` →
> export, verified to within 19 ms of expected duration, by frame MAE against the
